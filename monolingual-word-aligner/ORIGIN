Git clone: https://github.com/ma-sultan/monolingual-word-aligner.git

Modifications:
=============
The aligner tool actually returns the indexes of aligned words and a list
of aligned words. But, we tweaked the system to return two more lists that
contained the list of words from each sentence.

The modifications are made in: 
aligner.py (from lines 1580 to 1584)
